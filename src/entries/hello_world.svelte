<h3>beginnings</h3>
<p>
	they're hard! i'm young enough I never really was around for the heyday of personal sites and
	weblogging, so the concept of throwing longform content out there for anyone and everyone to read
	feels a bit. . . vulnerable. I'm starting this one to document my experience at
	<a href="https://www.recurse.com">Recurse Center </a>. i'm thinking this will probably be mostly a
	professional blog for tech stuff. BUT i'm also recently off socials in general, so this may also
	become a dumping ground for thoughts generally.

<h3>what my brain is gnawing at</h3>
<p>
	I know I want to be working with more (applied) math than I have gotten to in the past few years.
	I really miss it for reasons I can't really even explain -- solving problems with math just feels
	good and interesting and satisfying to me. But I'm sort of struggling to articulate <i>how</i> and
	<i>what</i> I want to be learning. ("Math" is a broad category . . . .)
